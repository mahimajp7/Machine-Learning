We have used CSV format for files.
CSV format files are turned in.

Please use the command:

mynaivebayes("TrainDataPath", "TestDataPath")
In our example:
mynaivebayes("C:/traincsv.csv", "C:/testcsv.csv")

Please install all the required packages. These install packages are commented in the file. Please uncomment them and install.

We have used 90-10 partition on the training data set.
